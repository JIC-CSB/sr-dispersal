        <p>Each year, asexual urediniospores of wheat stem rust can enter temporal zones anew via wind transmission,
            traveling up to hundreds of kilometres from their origin in regions with milder continental climates.
            However, stem rust also has the ability to survive between crop seasons in temporal zones through the production
            of hardy overwintering teliospores that can form on rust-infected plant debris.
            These teliospores germinate in the spring, producing basidiospores that can infect the pathogenâ€™s alternate host,
            common barberry (Berberis vulgaris) and other Berberis species.
            Once on the alternate host, the pathogen may complete sexual reproduction, leading to the emergence of novel
            genotypes and races.
        </p>
        <p> Eradication of common barberry (B. vulgaris) in the UK drove stem rust to almost complete extinction.
            However, over the past decade, barberry planting has reinitiated and stem rust has re-emerged in western Europe.
            To assess and mitigate the risk of sexual variants emanating from barberry infecting cereal crops we studied how
            far spores could travel from the barberry bush. We used mathematical modelling to assess the risk of planting
            barberries near whea fields by using a dispersal model (to know more about the model, please <a href="/dispersal/about">go here</a>)

            This data will then feed into models assessing the risk to cereal crops
             under different environmental scenarios. This will contribute to broad assessments of the probability of positive
              and negative outcomes of factors generating rust epidemics, including barberry planting, on a large scale throughout
              the UK
            Therefore, there is a deep sense of urgency to establish the role of common barberry
            in harboring and enhancing the diversity of wheat rusts in the UK.
